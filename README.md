# Dogs vs Cats Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying images as either "dog" or "cat" using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The model takes in an image and predicts whether it contains a dog or a cat. This classification task is solved using a CNN, a deep learning model that is highly effective for image recognition tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of images of dogs and cats. These images are labeled as either "dog" or "cat." The dataset is available from the [Kaggle Dogs vs Cats competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

### Dataset Structure
- **/train/**: Training images
  - **/dogs/**: Images of dogs
  - **/cats/**: Images of cats
- **/test/**: Test images (optional for predictions)

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image processing)

You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
